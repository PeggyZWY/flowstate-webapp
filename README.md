## Philosophy  
> Flowstate is guided by a simple philosophy: flow, then react. It is the first writing tool to emphasize the distinction between writing and editing. Unlike other writing programs, Flowstate features a sacred space for initial creation, with rigid laws enlisted to unleash a personâ€™s thoughts, feelings and ideas like water.  
  
    
## flowstate-react  
This app was rewritten in React three years after the original static website in mid 2019.  

Go to `flowstate-react/` directory and follow the instructions to start the app locally. After setup, you can use it without network.  

The [online version](http://peggyzwy.github.io/flowstate-webapp/) is still available, which is automatically deployed from the React app. Check [this article](https://peggyzwy.github.io/2020-02-08/how-to-deploy-react-app-to-github-pages-with-travis-ci/) to know how to do it.
