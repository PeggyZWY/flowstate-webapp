## Philosophy  
> Flowstate is guided by a simple philosophy: flow, then react. It is the first writing tool to emphasize the distinction between writing and editing. Unlike other writing programs, Flowstate features a sacred space for initial creation, with rigid laws enlisted to unleash a person’s thoughts, feelings and ideas like water.
